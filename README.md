# CSE 571: Neural Network for Collision Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using neural networks to help a small robot navigate a simulated environment without colliding with walls or obstacles. The neural network predicts potential collisions based on sensor readings, helping the robot make safer navigation decisions. This project aims to deepen your understanding of neural network training, PyTorch, data collection, and model evaluation.

## Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn to:
- Collect and manage a dataset for training and testing a neural network.
- Implement PyTorch `DataLoaders` to handle datasets effectively.
- Design a custom neural network architecture in PyTorch.
- Evaluate and improve the model's performance through simulations.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Python Version**: 3.10
- **Dependencies**:
  - `cython==3.0.3`
  - `matplotlib==3.8.0`
  - `scikit-learn==1.3.1`
  - `scipy==1.11.3`
  - `pymunk==5.7.0`
  - `pygame==2.5.2`
  - `pillow==10.0.1`
  - `numpy==1.26.1`
  - `noise==1.2.2`
  - `torch==2.2.0`
  - `torchvision==0.17.0`

It is recommended to use Anaconda for managing dependencies and environments.

## Tasks
- Collect data samples containing sensor readings, actions, and collision status.
- Create PyTorch `DataLoaders` for training and testing datasets.
- Implement a custom neural network using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.
- Train the neural network and evaluate its ability to predict collisions accurately.
